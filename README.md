# Simulator

Initial position: [0,0] <br>
Initial direction: east (E) <br>
Grid: 10x10

## Project Specifications

-  create a console app that handles simulation for a vehicle
-  define a grid and specify a starting point for the vehicle
-  accept command input to move and rotate the vehicle within the grid
-  log movements, rotations, simulations, errors, etc
-  revert position and direction if the vehicle tries to go outside the limits of the grid, for instance [1,11] is unacceptable
-  validate input, handle errors and provide descriptive error messages. Invalid commands (anything other than F,B,R,L) will be rejected

## Process

Coded with JavaScript in a node environment with nodemon for faster iterations and streamlined development. I added multiple functions calls to demonstrate how the script handles different scenarios, edge cases, invalid input, errors, etc
